## Vision
No matter what your background, most people in the United States have interacted with Cognitive Systems whether they know it or not. Most mobile phone users have experience asking for assistance from such technologies as Google, Apple SIRI, and Alexa. Others may be familiar with technologies such as IBM Watson 

The premise is that each person has their own unique experiences and that you donâ€™t have to be an expert in AI or cognitive science, identify areas where applications can be used to provide human-like abilities using such technologies as Amazon Alexa, and Apple SIRI to name a few. 

The general plan for the workshop is a brief overview of machine learning and AI followed by some practice with tools and packages developed by Intel that aid in the development and implementation of these algorithms. A more detailed plan will be developed and distributed (if interest is high enough).

### Workshop Outline
The workshop will focus on three key areas:

(1)	Learning and Basic understanding of AI and Cognitive Concepts

(2)	Practical Applications using existing technologies

(3)	Brainstorming Ideas for Future Applications

The long-term goals are to promote work that incorporates insights from human cognition to suggest novel business ideas, create new and interesting applications and improved AI architectures.
