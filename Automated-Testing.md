# Test Automation Strategy for Agile Projects
In today’s competitive climate with app being measured not only by their capabilities but also their social score, it’s often better to release one “rock solid” feature rather than several poor quality or poor performing features.
At a minimum, your automation strategy must ensure that any newly developed features don’t introduce any regression defects, so automating regression testing is the first order of business.

As teams move toward continuous integration (CI) / continuous delivery (CD), test automation becomes a core activity used to provide teams with the rapid feedback loop required for the development teams to better understand the health of the application under development.

In this post we will provide an overview of test automation concepts, practices and tools.

## Testing Basics
Here are several items that should be considered in order to get this quick feedback as part of the development of new features. The automated test cases should be
1.	Executed continuously as part of the both the CI and CD deployment cycles to reduce the possibilities that test resources waste time with test unstable builds 
2.	Fast providing rapid test results that can be used to make quick course corrections to the upcoming code changes
3.	Planned as part of a coherent testing approach where quality is “baked in” right from the start

This approach often requires “inverting the test automation pyramid” by pushing down GUI tests that take a long time to execute, to lower levels e.g. API layer that can run straight after unit tests as part of the build to provide the initial level of confidence.
hich we can obtain feedback quickly is formulated.

As already mentioned, quick feedback on the health of the application is of huge importance to support continuous delivery, therefore, a process and a mechanism by w
Automating testing is one of the key components needed to successfully implement an overarching Agile Test Strategy.  In this document we will share several of the key points that should be considered to get the most out of your existing test assets.  This strategy assumes that the project is using a continuous delivery model where several agile teams (e.g., Agile Release Train) must work together to deliver a complex software solution.

## Test Approach
The first element of any effective test automation effort is creating and automating the Unit testing performed by the developers.  Unit testing is the foundations of any test automation effort. 
The second element of improvement is running the regression tests more frequently and aligned with the process of Continuous Integration, see later. 

Automation Testing should not be seen as an isolated task, but rather as a coherent activity embedded in the process. Increasing the number of unit tests, integration tests, and API tests execute as part of a CI build suite often ensures that the code changes are working at least at a basic level.
Defining Regression Test Scenarios.

Automated regression tests are the core of the Test Automation Strategy. Here are thrie
- Smoke testing
- Functional testing
- End to End Testing

### Smoke Testing, 
Smoke Testing is a subset of the full regression test assets used to sanity check the application before deploying it for additional testing such as load or user acceptance testing. Keep the number of test cases  run to just a few to make sure application is still functional.
Rule of thumb, if the common user flow cannot be loaded and smoke tests completed in less than 5 minutes than you need to fail the tests as is something major is probably not working.
The smoke test pack runs on every CI build / deploy and should be a mixture of API and/or GUI tests.

### Functional Testing 
Functional Testing is meant to check the application functionality in more detail than the smoke testing. 
Typically each team has several different test suites (e.g. regression packs) used for different purposes. If there are multiple teams working on different parts of the application, then each team will have their own regression packs focusing on the area that they are working on.
These packs should be able to run in any environment as and when required, provided the behavior of the features remain consistent throughout the environments. They are executed multiple times a day and should last no longer than 15 to 30 minutes.

As these functional tests are more detailed, then they will take longer to run therefore, it is important to have the majority of functional tests at API layer where tests can be executed faster so we could be within the 15 to 30 minutes time limit.
End-to-End Regression Pack, which tests the whole application as a whole. The aim of these tests is to ensure that various parts of the application which connect to various databases and third-party applications work properly.

### End-to-End testing
The End-to-End tests are not meant to test all of the functionalities as those are already tested in the functional regression packs, however, these tests are “light-weight” which just check the transitions from one state to another and a handful of the most important scenarios or user journeys.
These tests are mainly executed through the GUI, as they are checking how users would use the system. The time taken to execute these can vary from one application to another but they are usually run once a day or night.

# Test Automation for Multiple Agile Teams
Test Automation starts at the unit level. 


## Key roles
- Stakeholders and Product Owners(https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/roles/product-owner) evaluate new site feature ideas
- Business Analysts Information architects develop informed wireframes, interface behaviors, and labeling
- UX Designers create the overall look and feel of the website
- Developers decide which approaches to take based on user behaviors. They write, test and help deliver the code 
- Testers - validate that content is written to the appropriate audiences



## Getting Started with Personas
Many software development teams us "Personas" to provide a realistic representations of potential end users of the software.   Personas development belongs at the beginning of the project, as personas can inform site functionality, help uncover gaps, or highlight new opportunities.

> Personas help teams to focus their decisions by adding a layer of real-world consideration to their conversation. 
> They also offer a quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritize those features throughout the development process. 

An effective personas:

- Represent a major user group for your website
- Express and focus on the major needs and expectations of the most important user groups
- Give a clear picture of the user's expectations and how they're likely to use the site
- Aid in uncovering universal features and functionality
- Describe real people with backgrounds, goals, and values

### Testing Practices
Here are some key testing practices
- Unit tests should be written by developers for any new feature that is developed. These Unit Tests form the foundation of a larger automation practice that spans all the way up to the System GUI Tests.
-  It is the responsibility of the developers to ensure that for every new feature that is developed, a set of coherent and solid Unit Tests are written to prove that the code works as intended and meets the requirements.
- Unit Tests provide the most ROI to the team as they are very quick to run, easy to maintain and modify (as there are no dependencies) and when there are errors in code, it is quickly fed back to the developer.
- Unit tests are run on the developer’s machine as well as the CI environment.

### Tools
Software developers uses a number of open source projects to get their work done, such as
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - duh

## Automating Integration / API or Service Tests
While Unit Tests are based on testing the functions within a class, Integration Tests form the next level up from Unit Tests to test the classes that collectively make up the component to deliver a piece of functionality. These tests are executed only when the Unit Tests have run and passed.

### Practices
Service Tests are naturally run at API layer without the intervention of the GUI web interface; hence tests would be able to verify functionality in a pure form and because the tests talk directly to the components, they are fast to execute and will be part of the build.
Where necessary, mocks such as wiremock will be used to factor out the dependence of other 3rd party systems and when the downstream systems are not available to provide the data required for testing.
Integration Tests and/or Service Tests can be run on the developer’s machine as well and be part of the build, but if they start to take a long time, then it is best to run on the CI environment.
Tools such as SoapUI can be used for Service Tests.
### Testing Tools
## Application Testing
A typical e-commerce application can be split into different applications or “apps” that provide different functionalities. The concept of “App Testing” is where a group of tests that test the functionality of an App are organized together and run against the desired App. This pack will be useful in cases when a team wishes to release an individual App and would like to know whether it is functioning correctly.
Application Tests typically require an interface to interact with the different components, therefore it is anticipated that these tests are run via a browser on the GUI.
The purpose of App Testing is to ensure that features of the application are functionally correct. Because the tests are organized in a manner to provide confidence in the health of a particular app, these tests are normally referred to as Vertical Tests, since they execute “down” a particular app. The tests are very thorough and coverage is large.
Selenium WebDriver could be used to run these automated tests against the browser. This tool is the most popular for browser automation tests and provides a rich API to allow for complex verifications.

## End-to-End Scenario Tests
The GUI automated tests which are run against the system, serve as typical user flows, journeys or end-to-end scenarios. Due to issues with this type of tests (discussed below), these will be kept to a minimum. The end-to-end scenarios are included in the nightly regression pack.
